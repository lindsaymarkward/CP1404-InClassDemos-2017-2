# In-Class Code for CP1404 2017 SP2 Townsville, IT@JCU

This repo is a collection of demos and quick examples 
from the lectures of CP1404.  
_It is not intended to be best-practice, well-documented code._  
Some of it will be just fine, but I usually make no extra effort after class to "fix up" or complete examples.

## Classes Demo - Taco Battle
In the following files, you can find our fun demo of a "Taco leaderboard" game started in week 8:

  * user.py and test_user.py
  * team.py and test_team.py
  * tacobattle.py
